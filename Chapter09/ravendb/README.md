# Hands-on DDD with C# book code

The book is **work in progress** and as I am working through
chapters, the code will change.

The book will contain almost everything from the history of this repository so
I have no plans to have code per chapter.

The book is currently available as [early access eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-domain-driven-design-net).

You should be able to run the docker-compose up command from the chapter folder in
the Terminal window

docker-compose up

docker-compose down

Before we can save anything to RavenDB, we need to create a database. For this chapter, the
database name in the sample application code is hardcoded to Marketplace_Chapter9
